# Zero-Overhead Parallel Scans for CPUs

This repository contains implementations of parallel scan algorithms for multi-core CPUs,
which do not need to fix the number of available cores at the start,
and have zero overhead compared to sequential scans when executed on a single core.
These two properties are in contrast with existing work and are important when the parallelism of scans is mixed with task parallelism.
We achieve this by adapting the classic three-phase scan algorithms, and these adaptations also exhibit better
performance than the original algorithms on many cores. Furthermore, we adapt the chained scan with decoupled look-back
algorithm to also have these two properties.
While this algorithm was originally designed for GPUs, we show it is also suitable for
multi-core CPUs, outperforming the classic three-phase scans in our benchmarks.
Our adaptation of the three-phase reduce-then-scan algorithm is even faster,
and is the fastest parallel scan on any number of threads.

The scan algorithms are implemented using the [work-assisting scheduler](https://github.com/ivogabe/workassisting).

To run the benchmarks, the Rust compiler and cargo need to be installed. Furthermore gnuplot needs to be installed, as the benchmark code automatically generates charts of the results. The benchmarks can be run with `cargo run`. Depending on the processor, it may be needed to tune `AFFINITY_MAPPING` in `src/utils/thread_pinning.rs`. This specifies the order in which the cores of the processor are used.
